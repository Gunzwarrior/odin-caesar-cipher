This is my attempt at the first project of The Odin Project Ruby course : Caesar Cipher

I have to make a Caesar Cipher which is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

The cipher must pass this test :
caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"

Tips
  - remember how to convert a string into a number
  - don't forget to wrap form z to a
  - don't forget to keep the same case
